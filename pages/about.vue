          <p>
            The software industry is full of talent but building great software still feels harder than it should. 
            Businesses and clients struggle to find developers who can deliver. Developers want meaningful work and fair chances to grow. 
            And delivery often breaks down due to mismatched expectations and poor communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            Traditional hiring is slow, biased, and inefficient. And restricted to a smaller pool of talent. Resumes don’t tell the full story.  
            Interviews don’t reflect real work or there is too much power imbalance and pressure. Great developers get overlooked, while great clients waste time and budget trying to get things done.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, developers want to build skills, get feedback, and work on real problems that matter and make change happen.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-semibold text-white">So we built Dev IRL.</h2>
          <p>
            Dev IRL is a platform where real world coding challenges quests bring developers and clients together. 
            Clients post tasks. Developers pick them up, submit their work, and get hopefully thoughtful feedback and rewards. Simple as that really.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s a place where you grow by doing not just by saying. Developers build up a portfolio of completed work. 
            Businesses get access to a larger community of talent, bringing in working solutions and greater insight to their problems. Everyone learns and improves through collaboration.
          </p>

          <p>
            We encourage open estimation, communication, and transparency around expectations. We’re creating a more open, community first way to build software one small step at a time.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-semibold text-white">Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            We believe good software should be built in a way that’s transparent, respectful and in small iterative steps. Along the way it should be rewarding for everyone involved. 
            We want people to grow through doing meaningful work that is also helping others along the way.
          </p>
